            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>BizBoost is the socialized capital solution to bridge the gap between access to capital and entrepreneurship while also cultivating a better business community. As a P2P lending platform, BizBoost creates a space for small businesses to connect with accredited investors and business service providers.</p>

            <h2>Product</h2>
            <p>BizBoost is a Limited Liability Company Incorporated in Boynton Beach, Florida.</p>

            <h2>Market Research</h2>
            <h3>Industry</h3>
            <p>BizBoost is best described as a Peer 2 Peer (P2P) Lending Platform, however it is to be noted that the company facilitates lending relationships and transactions. The company does not actually take possession of investment assets or lend money to prospective Borrowers. Market research was completed on P2P lending as this is the industry most closely related to the companyâ€™s performance.</p>
            <p>The global peer to peer (P2P) lending market size was valued at US$ 83.79 billion in 2021 and it is projected to increase to over US$ 705.81 billion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 26.7% from 2022 to 2030. In 2021, the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market was dominated by North America. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are becoming more widely used, which is driving the expansion of the P2P lending market in North America. The need for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in the area is also being fueled by the growth of small to mid-size enterprises, the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, and the limitations of the heavily regulated traditional lending space.</p>

            <h3>P2P Lending Industry Outlook</h3>
            <p>There are roughly 32 million small businesses in the U.S. Financing for these businesses generally is sourced from either internal financing (family, friends, or personal savings) or external financing (bank loans). Statistics from 2019, show that 77% of businesses use cash flow from operations as their primary source to finance working capital timing differences and growth, however this creates a challenge for those less established businesses.</p>
            <p>Start-Up (less than 2 years of business) financing options are limited to either debt and equity and often depend on their own resources for capital due to the traditional banking sector limitations. 75% of new businesses use personal savings while 19% report using a bank loan for startup capital (Figure 1). The shortfall creates a need in the market for unconventional alternative financing. BizBoost is designed as a marketplace that will help fill the void and bridge the gap.</p>

            <h2>Future of the Company</h2>
            <p>Small to midsize businesses in the US are troubled with insufficient access to capital and an inadequate lending paradigm that lacks innovation. The US is home to roughly 32 million small businesses, while that number grows exponentially to 400 million globally.</p>
            <p>Of the 32 million small businesses in the US, 37% of employer firms and 24% of non-employer firms are seeking access to capital. 29% of larger non-employer firms received full funding, compared to only 17% of smaller non-employer firms in 2020. There is a population of 11 million domestic businesses that seek traditional financing, while 2.3 million are a population of underfunded businesses.</p>
            <p>This forces the dream of entrepreneurship to be fueled with alternative financing sources such as high interest credit card debt, home equity lines of credit, and liquidation of personal assets. In response to this lending climate, BizBoost is the alternative financing solution to bridge the gap.</p>
